# Old Personal Website Offer Page
This is a landing page I created to sell website services to local businesses, especially focused on **Landing Pages**.

## About the Project
The page was designed to speak directly to local business owners who need a clear, strategic online presence, not just a beautiful site, but one that helps turn visitors into customers.

It includes:
- Direct copy focused on pain points of local businesses
- Visual proof with real project screenshots
- Clear service segmentation (Landing Page, Smart Sites, Google Ads)
- Strategic positioning around conversion and lead generation

## Design Choices
I chose a dark (black-based) layout simply because I like it. It brings contrast, focuses the attention on the red highlights, and gives a modern, clean feel.  
The style is minimal, but sharp, built to emphasize clarity and trust.

## Technologies Used
- Wordpress
- Elementor Plugin
- Hello Elementor Theme

## Status
Archived. This project was created in 2021, during a phase where selling websites to local businesses was one of my main focuses.

I still build and sell websites today, but itâ€™s no longer my core offer, and I now use different pages, tools, and strategies. This landing page reflects how I structured and communicated offers at that time.
